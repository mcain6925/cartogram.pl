<b><u>Links</u></b>
<p>
The following list contains links to other sites
of possible/probable interest.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.activestate.com/activeperl"</a>ActivePerl</a><br>
The main script/program of interest here is written in Perl and
requires three add-ons:
GD, GD::Polyline, and Geo::ShapeFile.
One way to get the necessary software is ActiveState's ActivePerl product.
ActivePerl is free for personal use and available for all of
Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
All three add-ons are available through the ActivePerl package manager.<br><br>

<li><a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a><br/>
Strawberry Perl is a free Perl installation for Windows.
Strawberry Perl comes with a complete C/C++ development kit
which supports the "normal" Perl way of acquiring things through
<a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>.
The packagers' stated goal is to have Strawberry Perl provide an experience
as much like using Perl on UNIX
as possible.<br><br>

<li><a href=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/>Mark Newman's <i>cart</i> Pages</a><br>
Mark Newman provides several pages with information about the <i>cart</i> and <i>interp</i> programs
which implement the method described in the paper
"Diffusion-based method for producing density equalizing maps",
Michael T. Gastner and M. E. J. Newman,
<i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA</i> <b>101</b>,
7499-7504 (2004),
and the program's source code.
<i>Cart</i> does the heavy lifting for the contiguous cartograms my software produces.
The Worldmapper site linked below uses the same algorithm
(and quite possibly the same code).<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW Home Page</a><br>
<i>Cart</i> uses the FFTW discrete Fourier transform library.<br><br>

<li><a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/">PROJ</a><br>
PROJ is a collection of software for cartographic projections.
The <i>cs2cs</i> program that is part of the collection
can be used to convert outline information from one projection to another.
For example,
there is lots of map data available with
coordinates given in latitude and longitude.
In many cases,
an alternative such as the Albers equal-area conic projection
(used by the US Geological Survey and US Census Bureau, developed by Heinrich C. Albers in 1805)
is preferred.
Maps generated by my software default to the Albers projection,
with options for a few others.<br><br>

<li><a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">Ffmpeg</a><br>
<i>Ffmpeg</i> is a cross-platform command-line Swiss Army knife for video and audio conversion.
<i>Cartogram.pl</i> invokes <i>ffmpeg</i> to convert
sequences of PNG frames into MP4 video clips.
See the Eye Candy page for examples.<br/><br/>

<li><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d348614c97264ae19b0311019a5f2276">ArcGIS Cartogram Geoprocessing Tool</a><br>
ArcGIS is a commercial mapping tool sold by ESRI.
ESRI is a leading vendor of geographic information system software and
created the shapefile format.
That file format
(a "shapefile" is actually three or more related files)
is regulated by ESRI and is a (mostly) open specification.
The linked page allows ArcGIS users
to download and install a cartogram add-on
for the commercial product.<br><br>

<li><a href=http://scapetoad.choros.ch>ScapeToad</a><br>
ScapeToad is a Java implementation of the Gastner/Newman algorithm
together with a graphical user interface.
ScapeToad works with ESRI shapefiles.<br><br>

<li><a href="http://sunsp.net/portfolio.html">Shipeng Sun's Portfolio Page</a><br>
Shipeng Sun is author of a paper presenting a new algorithm
for producing contiguous cartograms,
"A Fast, Free-Form Rubber-Sheet Algorithm for Contiguous Area Cartograms",
Sun, S.,
<i>International Journal of Geographic Information Science</i> 27 (3):
567-93 (2013).
A Windows-only program for producing cartograms using the algorithm
is available through his portfolio page.<br><br>

<li><a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/topogram">Shawn Allen's Cartogram Tool</a><br>
Shawn Allen has written a cartogram tool in JavaScript that implements
Dougenik, Chrisman, and Niemeyer's 1985 algorithm.
The animation changing from one thematic variable to another is pretty cool.
<a href="https://maggielee.net/georgia-county-cartogram/">Here</a> is an example of the animation.
I blatantly stole the idea at least as far as transforming from
a flat map to a cartogram
(see the Eye Candy page).<br><br>

<li><a href=http://www.worldmapper.org/>Worldmapper</a><br>
Worldmapper has a large number of contiguous cartogram world maps
illustrating an array of population and other variables.
In addition to the cartograms,
Worldmapper provides access to the data used to generate the cartograms,
including intermediate calculations,
which is both terrific of them and unfortunately rare.
Sources for the data are also identified.
Many of the maps are available as high-resolution PDF files
suitable for printing posters.<br><br>
