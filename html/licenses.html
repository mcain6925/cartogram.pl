<b><u>Licenses</u></b>
<p>
No discussion of "free" software is complete without
some mention of the various licenses.
Assorted links on this page pointing to where source code
for things included in the downloadable bundles
can be obtained.
I think I'm covered.

<p>
<b>cartogram.pl</b><br/>
The program <i>cartogram.pl</i>,
and any executable binary files based on it,
are licensed under
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">the GNU General Public License version&nbsp;3</a>.
Fundamentally:
<ul>
<li>
What you do with the software in the privacy of your own computer
is your own business.
Acknowledgement if you use cartograms generated by the software is nice,
but not required.
<li>
If you choose to redistribute the software,
or a modified version of it,
you <i>must</i> do so under the same terms.
That is,
provide the source code (including your enhancements, if any),
maintain the copyright markings (and add your own as necessary),
use the same license or its successors.
No charging money other than nominal fees to cover the actual costs
of producing physical media if such are used.
</ul>

<p>
<b>cart</b><br/>
So far as I can tell,
the <i>cart</i> software is unrestricted in any fashion.
The copy I downloaded from the University of Michigan
does not include either copyright or licensing terms.
However,
see the libfftw note.
It appears (at least to me, although IANAL) that the use of libfftw imposes an obligation to redistribute.
<i>cart</i> source code is available
<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/">here</a>,
and is also included in the bundles.
Some years back Michael Gastner gave me approval by e-mail to distribute
executables for the Windows operating system.
Prof. Gastner is now at the Yale-NUS in Singapore.

<p>
<b>libfftw</b><br/>
Libfftw,
on which <i>cart</i> depends,
is distributed under the GNU General Public License version&nbsp;2.
It is specifically <i>not</i> distributed under the Lesser GNU License
(sometimes called the library license).
As such,
it has (in my opinion) the "contagion" problem&nbsp;&ndash;
code that makes use of the library also falls under the GNU license.
Versions of libfftw
without the contagion problem
are available through the MIT Technology Licensing Office.
Libfftw source code is available
<a href="http://www.fftw.org/">here</a>.

<p>
<b>cs2cs</b><br/>
<i>cs2cs</i> is distributed under MIT's open-source license.
The MIT open-source license&nbsp;&ndash;
not to be confused with licenses obtained through MIT's licensing office
as previously mentioned&nbsp;&ndash;
is as close to being public domain as is possible
while still retaining a copyright notice.
Information on the PROJ project,
including source code,
is available
<a href="http://proj.org/">here</a>.

<p>
<b>Map files</b><br/>
Maps that are automatically generated
make use of shapefiles from the US Census Bureau.
There are no restrictions on use
except that the Bureau should be acknowledged.
I'd include some sort of pointer into the Census Bureau's web site,
but they seem to rearrange and rename things regularly,
creating lots of dead links.

<p>
<b>POV-Ray and MegaPOV</b><br/>
One of two different forms of the POV-Ray ray-tracing program are necessary,
depending on operating system.
POV-Ray version 3.7
for Mac and Linux
is covered by the GNU Affero General Public License.
MegaPOV version 1.2.1
for Windows
is a defunct project based on POV-Ray version 3.6.1
and is covered by the the same Affero license.
Technically,
a full installation of the POV-Ray software source code
seems to be required in order to use MegaPOV.
The necessary intallers for POV-Ray can be found
<a href="http://www.povray.org/download/">here</a>.
MegaPOV source downloads can be found
<a href="http://megapov.inetart.net/download.html">here</a>.

<p>
<b>ffmpeg</b><br/>
The <i>ffmpeg</i> core is covered under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version&nbsp;2.1 or later.
Some optional parts of the program are covered under the
GNU General Public License (GPL) version&nbsp;2 or later.
If those parts are included,
the GPL applies to all of <i>ffmpeg</i>
(see the contagion issue mentioned above).
<p>
<i>Ffmpeg</i> comes with an added licensing wrinkle:
patents.
According to their <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html">web page on legal considerations</a>,
it is <i>possible</i> that <i>ffmpeg</i> uses patented algorithms.
It's a complicated subject.
