<b><u>Answers to Obvious Questions</u></b>
<p>
So, some answers to the obvious questions.
<ol>
<li>
<b>Where are Alaska and Hawaii?</b>
<br><br>
The easy answer is that for my immediate purposes,
I don't care about Alaska and Hawaii.
Somewhat more seriously,
those two states represent a problem for a cartogram.
First,
in even an otherwise undistorted map like the first one on this page
Alaska and Hawaii are seldom shown to scale.
Hawaii doesn't total a lot of area but
the island chain is scattered over a length of 1500 miles,
about the distance from the middle of Iowa to Los Angeles.
And Alaska is just enormous.
When the initial map isn't showing those states to scale,
it may be difficult to recognize whether their areas
have changed or not
in the cartogram.
<br><br>
<li>
<b>Are cartograms good for everything?</b>
<br><br>
No.
The cartogram below is based on listing the 48 states
in alphabetical order using their two-character mailing abbreviation,
then assigning them a value between 51 and 145.
States that fall early in the list are small and light-colored,
states that fall near the end are larger and darker.
It doesn't <i>mean</i> anything.

<li>
<b>How'd you do it, and can I do it the same way?</b>
<br><br>
There are a number of commercial and free mapping tools that either
do cartograms natively or
support plug-ins of some sort that can do the job.
When I got more serious about wanting to do cartograms,
I looked at some of the free ones and decided
that I didn't want to use a GUI.
I'm an old-school command-line kind of guy for the most part.
