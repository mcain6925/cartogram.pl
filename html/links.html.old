The following list contains links to other cartogram-related sites
of possible interest.
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.worldmapper.org/>Worldmapper</a><br>
Worldmapper has nearly 700 continuous cartogram maps
illustrating a vast array of population and other variables.
In addition to the cartograms,
Worldmapper provides access to the data used to generate the cartograms,
including intermediate calculations.
Sources for the data are also identified.
Many of the maps are available as PDF posters.<br><br>
<li><a href=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/>Mark Newman's cart pages</a><br>
Mark Newman provides several pages with information about the <i>cart</i> program
which implements the method described in the paper
Diffusion-based method for producing density equalizing maps,
Michael T. Gastner and M. E. J. Newman,
<i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA</i> <b>101</b>,
7499-7504 (2004).
Cart is the foundation for the software provided on this site.
The Worldmapper site uses the same algorithm.<br><br>
<li><a href=http://scapetoad.choros.ch>ScapeToad</a><br>
ScapeToad is a Java implementation of the Gastner/Newman algorithm
together with a graphical user interface.
ScapeToad works with esri shapefiles.
Esri is a leading vendor of geographic information system software.
The shapefile format
(a "shapefile" is actually three or more related files)
is regulated by esri and is a (mostly) open specification.
One of the reasons for the software on this site
is to avoid some of the complexities of dealing with the shapefile format.<br><br>
<li><a href=http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/>PROJ.4</a><br>
PROJ.4 is a collection of cartographic projections software.
The <i>cs2cs</i> program that is part of the collection
can be used to convert outline information from one projection to another.
For example,
there is lots of map data available with
coordinates given in latitude and longitude.
In many cases,
an alternative such as the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection
is preferred
(the flat map of the US on the introduction page is in that format).
For simply using the software and outline files on this site,
you don't have to worry about projections.
